OUR PROJECT
---------------------------------
Keywords: Ä°oT, Air Quality, Temprature and Humidity of Air

Air pollution is one of the biggest problems we face today. It is a fact that the increase in air pollution, which has negative effects on human health, climate and ecosystems, contributes to the increase in the amount of pollutants in the atmosphere as well as the air quality in indoor environments. People who spend most of their daily lives in closed indoor environments (homes, offices, schools, hospitals, shopping malls, etc.) are affected by harmful gases and particulate matter in the ambient air and may experience health problems. Living standards in such environments should be kept at optimum values for human life and factors that may threaten human health should be identified and eliminated or their effects should be reduced. Thanks to technological developments, it is possible to eliminate such problems with systems that determine the air quality of the environment. In this study, an IoT-based indoor air quality monitoring system was realized. ESM8266 NodeMCU V3 control card, temperature, humidity and gas sensors are used in the system. The indoor data received through the sensors were processed and obtained through the control card and sent to the web interface from the static IP address. With the prepared web interface, information on living conditions in the indoor environment can be monitored instantly. Using the developed air quality formula, indoor air quality is calculated and transmitted to users. With the portable hardware platform, it is possible to determine the air quality of any indoor environment.
